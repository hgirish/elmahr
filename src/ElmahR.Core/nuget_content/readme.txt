ElmahR.Core README
===================

Please look for the 'elmahr' section in web.config, a sample 'application'
section has been added there, you will want to duplicate that one for each
monitored application you have to monitor with this dashboard, and then
configure it accordingly.

More comments have been added to your web config to explain what else you
could or should do, for more details please refer to docs here:

    https://bitbucket.org/wasp/elmahr/wiki/Setup

A page called 'basic.cshtml' inside 'ElmahR' folder has been added to your 
project, along with proper routing rules, this is where your basic ElmahR 
log lives, and it's reachable with the '/elmahr/basic' relative path.
