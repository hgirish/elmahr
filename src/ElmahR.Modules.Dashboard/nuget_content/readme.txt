ElmahR.Modules.Dashboard README
===============================

This module installs a full fledged interactive error dashboard, where you
can see errors coming down live, and statistics updated in real time.

A page called 'dashboard.cshtml' inside 'ElmahR' folder has been added to your 
project, along with proper routing rules, this is where your basic ElmahR 
log lives, and it's reachable with the '/elmahr/dashboard' relative path. 
Related css and js files, along with images, have also been added.

In order to properly configure the dashboard please refer to ElmahR.Core
related info.
