ElmahR.Persistence.MongoDB README
=================================

This package installs an ElmahR persistor based on MongoDB. In your
web.config you will have to provide the necessary connection string to an
empty destination database. A related connection string entry named
MongoDB has been added, you'll have to adapt it to your current setup.
